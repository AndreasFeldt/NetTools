Batch and Powershell script to quickly and efficently configure a NIC

Put the scripts in a folder of your choice, edit line 2 of "Conf.bat" and replace the 
text inside of the tripple quotations with the full path to the powershell script.

After that go to the last line of the powershell script (line 98) and replace the 
text inside of the tripple quotations with the full path to the powershell script.

After that i'd recommend to crate a shortcut to Conf.bat and on the shortcut 
rightclick and press "Properties" -> "Advanced" -> and check the "Run as administrator" box
